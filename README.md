# Handwritten Digit Recogniser with a Full MLOps Workflow

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end workflow for building, training, fine-tuning, and deploying a deep learning model to recognise handwritten digits. The application is built using PyTorch and containerised with Docker, with all experiments tracked using MLflow.

## Features

* **Deep Learning Model:** A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with PyTorch for image classification.
* **Experiment Tracking:** All training and fine-tuning runs are tracked with **MLflow**, logging parameters, metrics, and model artifacts.
* **Robust Training:** K-Fold cross-validation is used to ensure the model is robust and to select the best performing base model.
* **Transfer Learning:** The base model is **fine-tuned** on a small, custom dataset of user-drawn digits to adapt to a specific drawing style.
* **Containerisation:** The entire application is containerised using **Docker**, ensuring a consistent and reproducible environment.
* **Web Application:** A simple web interface built with **Flask** allows users to draw digits and receive predictions.
* **Cloud Deployment:** The final containerised application is deployed on **Hugging Face Spaces** for public access.

## Methodology

The project was executed in two main stages to build a robust and personalised model.

### 1. Base Model Training

First, a CNN was trained on the standard MNIST dataset. To ensure the model was robust and to select the best possible version, a 5-fold cross-validation strategy was used. Each fold was logged as a separate run in **MLflow**. We tracked key parameters (learning rate, epochs, etc.) and metrics (accuracy, F1-score) to compare the folds. The model from the best-performing fold (`best_model_fold_2.pt`) was saved and selected as the base model for the next stage.

### 2. Fine-Tuning on Custom Data

After training a general-purpose digit recogniser, a small dataset of 300 custom drawings (30 for each digit) was created. The best base model was then loaded, and its early convolutional layers were **frozen**. Only the final, fully-connected classification layers were retrained on this new dataset. This transfer learning approach allows the model to adapt to a specific user's handwriting style without needing a large dataset. This fine-tuning process was also tracked as a separate experiment in MLflow.

## ⚙️ Setup and Local Usage

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-link>
    cd <your-repo-name>
    ```

2.  **Create and activate the Conda environment:**
    ```bash
    conda create --name mnist-mlops python=3.9
    conda activate mnist-mlops
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Run the MLflow UI:** Open a separate terminal, activate the environment, and run:
    ```bash
    mlflow ui
    ```
    You can view the tracking server at `http://localhost:5000`.

5.  **Run the training and fine-tuning scripts:**
    ```bash
    # Train the base model on MNIST
    python train_with_mlflow.py

    # Fine-tune the best model on your custom drawings
    python fine_tune_with_mlflow.py
    ```

6.  **Run the prediction app:**
    ```bash
    # Make sure you have the final fine-tuned model saved
    python interact.py
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000` (or the port specified in the script).
